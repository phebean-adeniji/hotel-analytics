4/5,"This was the ""headquarters"" for the family when we visited recently for our nieces  wedding to her Nigerian fiance. The facility Is centrally located and encompasses 3 different hotels on one complex. It was safe secure and  included a buffet breakfast with a huge selection of food to choose from. It was an ideal spot and one of the best family oriented hotels in Lagos. With an outdoor pool and different Hotels and bars on the complex You did not have to leave if you didn't want to!There were readily available cabs to take to different locations that you wanted to visit. Some of the rooms could do  with some upgrading and repairs....but Overall It was great value for the cost of the rooms and I definitely recomend it!",[]
4/5,"Excellent space for office programs/retreats. Rooms were fair enough; spacious and neat. Only issue I had was that the water in the bathroom wasn't hot enough. Also, I didn't like that the bath had only half 'door/shield' because water still spilled out and the floor ended up being flooded despite the floor towel.Food was great, we had dinner at Sky Restaurant. Loved the buffet service.",[]
5/5,It's a beautiful place with cool fresh breeze because of the trees there. The meeting rooms are amazingly conducive. Nice reception too.,[]
5/5,"A place I love to visit once in awhile because of the serenity and infrastructure put in place.The best hotel and suites in Nigeria as far as I know for now, with the advantage of the ocean view.",[]
5/5,"Beautiful, well decorated hotel in the heart of Victoria Island.  I was not staying there.  However, I came in next door to look at Nigerian Arts and Crafts.  And, we went to the hotel.  The front was exquisitely decorated with Christmas lights.  We walked through the lobby and went to the rear, which is beautiful.  There are several restaurants, a beautiful pool, a playground, and more.  The yard leading to the extensive playground is decorated with beautiful sculptures.  It is just a breathtaking place.  I don't  have enough words to describe the hotel.  I love, ‚ù§Ô∏è",[]

5/5,"Eko Hotels & Suites is one of the choicest hotels in Lagos State. Located in Victoria Island, the hotel has ocean view. It's serene and edifying ambience is a delight.The hotel boasts of superb rooms of different classes and uses, and excellent services.Its proximity to military bases and barracks complements it's on site security apparatus which is above average.It is a wonderful place to be.",[]
5/5,"A serene environment with large enough space , well exhibitions with a lot of other side attractions of natural essence.Expo hall was well arranged and decorated  & accommodate  large crowd  recommended for any international symposium.",[]
5/5,Hung out by the pool side with my friends. The live band was engaging and the music was soo good. The food and service was great too. I really enjoyed the poolside ambiance and the decor,[]
4/5,The rooms were just okay. But they had this odd smell for me. Dint like that at all.The place is big and it was the festive season so it was really crowded.,[]
4/5,The place is well done but doesn't live up to the 7 Star standard. Be careful of the toilets some were unclean in the common areas.,[]
5/5,Their buffet is delicious and very affordable. Food was well arranged and the waiters were too courteous,[]
5/5,Great place to stay. Cool reception. Nice ambience and indeed relaxing after a hectic Lagos day out! You'll love the experience and will worth the effort.,[]
5/5,"I usually recommend Eko hotel for any event. The car park, space and ambience is topnotch. Though I feel the general toilet where men do number 2 can be cleaner.",[]
4/5,"Stayed at Signature. The aesthetics is great but they wanted to take an hour to make fries lol, just.Idk if it‚Äôs first day syndrome or idk the elevator wasn‚Äôt working and they don‚Äôt have stairs to goUp, just the elevator.",[]
1/5,It was wonderful  visiting  Eko hotels  again and again.  Beautiful  and entertaining environment . Good food. Good Services.  Wonderful staffs,[]
5/5,"The hotel is very spacious but their car park is not enough for the customers, also, more security personnel are needed to direct new customers to avoid wonderers.",[]
5/5,"Wow!Eko Hotel is as beautiful and as comfortable as they get.It is a 5-star hotel and you sure get that 5-stqr treatment.Where do I begin from?The complimentary Buffet Breakfast that has an array of local and intercontinental dishes?Or the beautiful bonding moments created due to the cozy nature of the RBG Restaurant on the Ground floor of the suites?The amazing security and their attention to details?The properly air-conditioned rooms?The spacious suite?The attention to details?The accessible roads?Eko hotels ticks all the boxes for me.If you are coming to lodge here, you need to know that there are 4 'hotels' in this '1 hotel', so, you can choose appropriately.I loved the meals! I loved the ambience.The facility is Wheelchair-accessibleThere is a recycling bin on every floor too.",['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7igcSnZOiNvYUE7G-pM2HuGiKmMGXHZhxU7XZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']
5/5,Fantastic experience..Buffet Breakfast is Top Notch .The DJ at the Red Restaurant  at Eko Hotels  is the best .Rooms extremely clean and well taken care off .The Landry service was  fabulous,[]
4/5,"Got the room facing the waterfront, lovely view I must say but for 100k a night the room was rather  small. They can do better with appliances though. The kettle in the room was not working and I need to boil some water for coffee. The breakfast buffet can be better. No chicken, beef, turkey or fish was in sight at breakfast. Just some fish sauce and sausages.",[]
5/5,"Eko Hotel is defined as a happening place. Hahaha. I love the environment.. most especially the ambience at night and beautiful coffee shop therein. No other way to talk about the room service but wow!!! They give you a kingly treatment.. Come with you babe, family, and friends and trust me, you will always want to return with an anticipation that always results to happiness.",[]
1/5,"Too run down, outdated,  needs major revamp of the hotel and facilities. I wouldn't book here for any function and pricy for what you get.",[]
5/5,"It was a nice, welcoming environment, with different things to enjoy.",[]
3/5,I watched the Arise Fashion show and spent the night.The food service during the show was slow and disorganized.The room service was much better.,[]
5/5,"One of the greatest business hub in  Lagos State with numerous businesses at a goal, Eko Hotel is just like living in 9 star ‚ú® hotel. One of the biggest Hotel in Lagos and  Nigeria...It acomodates foreigners than any other Hotels in Logos, it is also location at the heart beat of Lagos close to beach...The environment is top notch and second to none. There is a big swimming pool, sports center, different continental dishes restaurant, a mini art shop at the entrance, numerous event halls and meeting halls, if there is anywhere to visit and have the vibe that you are outside the country just visiting Eko Hotel and Suites...The security is very tight and open to all 24/7...",[]
5/5,I have been there since Saturday and everything and everyone is nice but their customer care is quite slow . It takes a lot of time for them to answer when you call them to help. The breakfast is to die for. And they take corrections without prejudice,[]
5/5,"This is a great place and the managers of this hotel seems to also have the family theme at the back of their minds. When you make a report, the management seems to respond quickly. Great place.",[]
4/5,"Prime restaurant: ambience is good, polite staff, food tasted good though the salmon appetiser was a bit too salty. Bring back the steamed hand towels please. Overall, as first timers, we were pleasantly surprised. üëç",[]
3/5,Cool experience but I couldn't get my complementary breakfast brought to my room...,[]
5/5,"It has different halls you can use to host events. The halls have huge capacity. The environment is is beautiful one as well, and they have good security",[]
5/5,Very nice place and silent area. I love there service,[]
4/5,"My experience there was nothing short of excellence from environment to everything, just some senior staff that sour my experience with their overzealousness, that why am giving a 4 star and not 5",[]
5/5,"One of the very good 5 Star hotel you can think of going. It's high class yes but it's worth the money. Events are going on in different areas of the building. Lots of restaurants are available around there. Enough space, serene environment. They have very good sound system available on request. I think it comes with the package of what you paid. Swimming pool too is good. If you have the money, it's worth visiting.",[]
4/5,"I went for Sunday Brunch.The service was great, Michael was our host,he was very courteous and professional.Rating the food 5/10, it was ok.",[]
5/5,"This is still one of the best place to be, car park, restaurant, event place, swimming pool and lots more.....",[]
4/5,"Other related services for banking, local transportation and access to local food stores and shops ,food vendors and FX are within range if you have a reliable guide and resources information mobile application.",[]
4/5,"It was an okay experience.Amazing view, polite attendants and a good sense of security.  I visited a few of their regular rooms which were a bit okay but the toilets in the regular rooms were quite small in my opinion.  I think they can do better with how first timers can locate their main buildings because they have quite a big compound.",[]
4/5,"Nice ambience, big and well equipped. But very overpriced for the amenities and services they provide. I have stayed here several times as it‚Äôs quite close to my meeting point. Rooms are spacious, very clean and lovely views of the pool and beach.The bathroom has everything you‚Äôd need for a short stay (aside toothpaste or brush).WiFi is a little slower than normal but still manageable. There‚Äôs no mini bar. Only a bottle of water in the room. You have to call for iron, no bathrobe nor slippers except you call.The lightings in the rooms need an upgrade to brighter lights and the lights directly over the television completely removed. Services are slow. Checked into a suite and phones weren‚Äôt working, went to reception to complain, it took over 2 hours before someone came to check and only one was fixed. Theres no internal communication amongst the staff. There‚Äôs no engineer on night duty, the safe box wouldn‚Äôt open so I had to wait for the engineer to get to work at 7:30am before I could check out to catch a flight. I hope the hotel improves. Overall, a nice hotel but over priced for the room quality and the slow service they render.",[]
5/5,"Main hotel rooms need updating, at the  minimum usb outlets to power phones. Also, the hotel should give more than 1 water bottle a day if they want to compete with the major chains. Restaurants and entertainment is great and they poolside is one of the best!",[]
4/5,"Great breakfast (buffet), prompt service response and beautiful location, however, unnecessarily expensive, rowdy reception and damp rooms/corridors.",[]

5/5,Eko Hotel one of the foremost 5 star hotels in Nigeria. It's situated in the heart of the Victoria Island and the night life around it its on surplus.,[]
4/5,"Eko Hotel's memory will have a lasting impact. The service is exceptionally great. The complementary buffet breakfast for lodging is also superb. One striking thing about my stay in Eko Hotel was that pressing iron was unbelievably made available for me to iron my rumpled shirt dousing my worries of looking unkept for a meeting. For business executives, Eko Hotel is could be a life saver within minutes of a business pitch. Just dial Laundry, the guys are very helpful with their services. Nice ambience, good hotwater bath tub, tasty meals. Everything nice!!! Truly a delightful stay. There's also a non-smokers wing if you can't put up with smells from cigarettes.",[]
5/5,Beautiful place.Loads of activities holding there and among the 5star hotel in Lagos.A safe haven,[]
5/5,"Awesome experience altogether.  Well space car park, hall setting.",[]
3/5,I had lunch at Eko hotel and Suites and was impressed with the infrastructure. It was beautiful and quite a big place. It had four huge building with different offerings and several restaurants. The restaurant I settled for was by a big pool with an inner lounge offering buffet and an outdoor space offering a la carte.The employees are nice and helpful although the restaurant service was below what you get in any eatery in south Africa. The waiter did not seem to have an appreciation of the menu and there were no candles or any solution to deter flies from invading the food.On a brighter side the place was buzzing with people an indicator that the offerings were good.I didn‚Äôt explore any other thing except for the good lunch I had so I don‚Äôt have much improve or reduce the average score.,[]
5/5,"A hotel that give you joy and happiness, good place to go.",[]
4/5,"Right from the main entrance, this hotel is different from others. With courteous staff at each point. Large parking space makes it convenient for visitors to choose the location to drop their cars. The halls for meetings were good with A/C cooling. Water dropping from the roof was noted at a point. I hope that is fixed soon.The room was good with bed well laid and comfortable. I couldn't get fome channels to watch which I had anticipated from an international hotel as this. The bathroom can slso do with a shower door or curtain to stop water spilling beside the ceramic throne and the corridor.The buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner were all on point. I give 5 stars for that alone. Friday night buffet with live music is an excellent concept. Keep it up",[]
3/5,"Same ol, same ol.. Most crowded hotel in all of Lagos. Can be a lil nerve-racking, topped with average service.",[]

5/5,The convention centre is a five-star event centre. Enough parking space and smack in the centre of town for those that can afford it.,[]
5/5,Exclusive and luxuriant. I have known this place for almost 40 years from when I was in primary school,[]
5/5,"Been to this beautiful space multiple times and the feeling was always different (positively of course).Haven‚Äôt passed the night here yet but I‚Äôve attended several events and they‚Äôve never disappointed me, not once.The organization, protocol, serenity and ambience does it for me, always.I truly appreciate the undisturbed flow of traffic (human and vehicular) in and out of this space which allows for several activities to take place concurrently without any interference of any sort. It‚Äôs very impressive.Mostly been here for conferences and the likes which includes tea breaks and lunch most times, yeah, the service was orderly and the meals were equally enjoyable.Here‚Äôs your cue to host your World Class Events, Conferences, Programs and the likes at Eko Hotels & Suites.Thank me now üòâ‚úåÔ∏è","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnclJ_ElMgU9jtoXwizTkDjlnsBdrur4q-w-CH=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbHwNRND579Idcii7K6ng4iFmGkD91XyWwsZMz=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7KsLFqZbCXG2wo0XI6rrrXQ7ktvrNxMyHjJti=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbC7pPBht0n0CHvIjGvTTc0lPQtFT9tXFDa1qL=w150-h150-k-no-p']"

4/5,Great event and nice rooms! Could be pricey here but this facility defines hospitality in Lagos!,[]
4/5,"I'm always amazed at the hotel's ability to continually recreate their environment...like the ever expanding universe. Kudos to the team.The rooms and bathrooms do need to continually be fixed up. Maintenance dept needs to keep up with needed repairs - or perhaps room service needs to be meticulous to report areas needing repairs.Overall though, it's one hotel on the island one is sure of overall good hospitality. üëç",[]
5/5,5star hotel in the economy nerve center of Africa in Lagos StateIt's widely known for the 5star hospitality industry in Victoria island Lagos,[]
5/5,Eko hotels has a very serene environment and a very elegant outlook.Another innovation I think they should implement is changing their room TV screens to smart TV. This is give us clearer pictures quality and ability for us to connect to the internet and explore other viewers options.Thanks so much,[]
5/5,Everything is top notch.Great environment.But my car was bathed and rear light broken and also the securities are claiming ignorance. No CCTV footage to present. So sad,[]
5/5,"The whole environment is so appealing with tall trees and flowers, tarred and interlocked pavements and roads. Car park is top notch. Eko Hotel and Suites really a 5 star hotel with international standards, although it's expensive as expected but it's really nice place to visit.",[]
4/5,"Awesome as usual.I must commend the security operations and how very respectful they are at Eko Hotel. Driving through the Garden complex and the Signature was quite an urban experience.There are more than enough carparks with little or no hassle to make it through.I'll share more updates here, when I finally make it into their rooms, pool, halls and restaurants. Although, I've been to the club ""Cross Roads"" about 3 years back and had a wonderful time and experience.You should visit if your pocket is right.",[]
5/5,So much fun and good value for money,[]
5/5,I love eko .the view is madddd beautiful,[]
5/5,"Every amenity and hospitality service(s) here; inclusive of the serene ambience is 95% legit, on point, and top-notch. You will get the message right from the entrance/exit of the main gate. The coordination and helpful guidance dispensed by her security personnel and other staff give one a sense of confidence and comfort. They only need to work on the sensors that trigger the flush system on the urinary bowl for men.However, my last visit here was one of the best moments of my life.And again I still find it hard to imagine a hotel that is as old as time and still can house mind-blowing innovation and state-of-the-art amenities, cum tech support. A wonder to ponder...ü§îü§îLife here is very expensive though, but, Eko üè® & $uites will always give you a golden memory to keep. If you know, you know.üòäüòäüá≥üá¨",[]

5/5,They have well trained staff who are professional. Easy access but the traffic going out was long and slow.,[]
3/5,"Eko Signature is a nice comfortable hotel with impressive views of the city. I love the quietness of the rooms and hallways. The Staff are very polite. I wasn't impressed with the service generally, had to wait a long time for any service. I had to call about four times in three hours to get someone to open the fridge in my room when I checked in. Room cleaning from when it was requested to when it was done took hours. Also, the phone numbers listed for reservations are hardly answered. I had to send someone there to physically make the reservation... What I kept hearing were apologies. I can't believe how a hotel this expensive has such disappointing service. Granted its a festive season with lots of guests but still it can be better.",[]
5/5,I loved the experience. The facilities were all intact and functioning in the room. The wardrobe space was adequate for myself and spouse. The staff at the reception were helpful and respectful.The service at breakfast which was a buffet was near excellent. The breakfast offerings were numerous and the service was fast and flowing like a well oiled factory plant. I was really impressed despite the number of people at the restaurant.I also used the Spa facility and the service was very good. The staff were professional and had a very good experience.,[]

4/5,Eko Hotel has good service but their facilities are showing their age. I like the way their housekeeping clean and arrange the room without attempting to pick at your personal belongings. The food tastes good and with broad variety.,[]
5/5,Very spacious. Enough parking space and the convention center is super huge,[]
5/5,"Beautiful place, same as when I first visited with my father 43 years ago as a child. It brought back so many memories. How on earth did they manage to keep up the quality?",[]

5/5,A great place for premium hotel services,[]
4/5,Pros:-The grounds are beautiful with large parking space- Easily accessible and located in the business district in VICons:- the standard room of the original Eko Hotel is very basic. Eko Signatures is newer with better facilities- the road leading to the hotel is prone to congestion at peak periods- hotel can be quite rowdy during events or conferences which could pose a safety/ security challenge especially for families with little kids.,[]
5/5,"I was confused at first but immediately u asked a security guard, he directed me to the conference hall perfectly.",[]
3/5,"Resort-style hotel(s) and building with varying levels(per price/luxury). Eko Hotel Signature is the top tier.Couple of different restaurants and a bar on site with indoor and outdoor sitting by the pool(cabana) available. Pricey though.Holds lots of concerts and parties with popular artists.Best pastries in the area..Eko Hotel Signature- not a fan of their limited breakfast. Staff such as Michael, Bukky are a great resource.Staff are generally polite and professional, but Lebanese managers are bullies- screams, yells at the staff.General manager on site notified of abuse of staff multiple times, but doesn‚Äôt seem to care. I guess a norm here.Maintenance of bathrooms, showers is a struggle, stains and leakage.Proper management may help.Overall- surrounding is safe and lively.",[]

3/5,"I heard a lot about this hotel but finally had the privilege to visit. Unfortunately I didn't stay so I cannot give an accurate picture of the experience.

I went there last Saturday and a child's birthday was holding right beside the pool , with children that couldn't all swim and the chocking part is that they had a giant balloon that kept entering the pool.. please let the management ensure that  some people guard the pool next time a party is holding. Better safe than sorry.",[]

2/5,"Avoid the buffets at all cost.Management appeared attentive but showed apathy by ignoring his offer, didn't reply to the email for follow-up and the staff worked harder to make amends for the uneventful Mexican food offered on the $25k naira per person Buffett.* Food was luke warm to tepid at best.* No real direction nor order on where to eat or enter.* Fried food should be served hot. Fresh* Tables were not cleared and we arrived at the start of the buffet event* Chef tried when I met with him. Our server was good when we got one. He stuck it out until it was time to go home.I was okay with just making do until the locals said the native dishes were not good, either. It's a sham because I did expect more since they charge top prices, advertise expensive events and label themselves 4-5stars. I'm shocked locals entertain such given their wealth and ability. Just go over to Padrino's should you have a Mexican craving.","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8pP2Fneg88umgarl8kwHRpP2M-r_EG0ZAEo8V=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHoGdDDz6R_sVdWxGvhyFr60d3dRW-7OvAYFE3=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1WR8pxYQzGfevbKxZl6gndNDkp8SO5FEesoEu=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeLZGvy961i9Zx3MYCpIhKq_SUFYaX2ECZhJEy=w150-h150-k-no-p']"

Had to make a  further cash payment again, and after almost a month of appealing against such unsavory custom service, I still have not got a refund on my card payment or even an apology. Still waiting on my refund. I personally think this erodes your brand capital.",[]
5/5,It's a very nice place hotel and clean,[]
5/5,Very good and copretive staff.,[]
4/5,"Their event facilities are great!I've never been to any Eko Hotel room but I've booked it for people and I hear the experience is great.I have, however, used their even halls on many occasions and they are great. The staff are also generally okay - organised, detailed, helpful.The halls are soundproofed. So even if they are having events in five halls at a time, you can't hear the noise from the other halls even if they are adjoining rooms. I appreciate and respect that. You can't even hear a heavy downpour if you are within the facility.Pricing for halls is also fair relative to other competitor hotels on the island.A recommendation though would be to have a safe storage for event props and ish so organisers don't have to move items especially in situations where an event runs for more than one day. They typically tell you to pack your items (excluding heavy items or fixture) and bring them the next day because they cannot guarantee the security of the items. They can do better.They also have a shuttle to take you from one building or location within the facility to another. Or say it's raining and you need a quick ride within the facility.",[]
4/5,"This is a good hotel in Lagos, Nigeria. I stayed here with a large group and they did a great job accommodating us. The food is delicious and the pool and views are amazing. The power did go out a few times during our stay. That‚Äôs really the only downside. Everything else was great:",[]
4/5,"Nice hotel within the environment. Pretty spendy. But I feel that you can enjoy the area around there if you're interested in checking out some art galleries,  or asking the front desk for a shuttle to the beach ‚õ±,  just watch out for the drivers they lurk around there.  They will overcharge you if they can.  If you're not familiar with the area, then just use bolt or uber.",[]

If you glance outside, you will see the large beach We‚Äôve spent a couple of luxurious days at the Ego Hotel and are sure to recommend it to others. Here are some tips I‚Äôve accumulated while staying at the hotel: Tip 1: Make sure to come inside after dawn or to wear mosquito spray if you go outside after dark. It can get pretty annoying being bitten by loads of mosquitoes.Tip 2: If you are feeling kind of hot, grab your swim suite and head downstairs to the pool to cool off. It‚Äôs clean and is chemically treated; so don‚Äôt worry about any urine c;Tip 3: There are several restaurants in the hotel, some of which have a splendid view so if you‚Äôd like just ask a staff member or look at a map of the hotel to see them all.Tip 4: If you‚Äôd like to go to the beach, feel free to do so, just that it would be safer if you come in before dark because there is a small chance of you getting robbed if you are outside the facilities. Inside the facilities though, it is one of the safest places in Lagos so don‚Äôt worry.Tip 5: Enjoy your stay, stay safe and relax.Overall, you will guarantied enjoy your stay at the Ego Hotel. I hope this review helped you decide your trip.If you‚Äôd mind liking this review, the would be extremely helpful to achieving my goal of helping as many people see and decide their trips as possible because liking my review will increase the chances of others seeing them.Last note: Make sure to follow Corona regulations: Wear a mask, wash your hands and stay safe!Hope this helped,Armin",[]

Excellent setting by the very alluring swimming pool, ambience was easy and calm with eager Waiters, conversations were engaging and the mood was business friendly.All was going well until Lunch was served and then the Flies swamped us. Trust me, the odd troublesome Fly in an outdoor eatery in the tropics is a given and tolerable but a swarm is certain to unsettle and ruin your meal.Food was average and could have been served at hotter temperatures. All in all, outdoor lunch dining in hot, humid conditions probably wasn't such a good idea. Maybe we should have settled for an evening timing and go away with better memories.If you must, remember to call ahead, reserve a table and place your orders to save you time and insist on portable Fly catchers.",[]

All in one place, you can enjoy the pool side bar (Calabar bar?), live band (I think it's Friday nights) and some of the finest Restaurants in Victoria Island (Crossroads, Sky, 1845, Lagoon Breeze,  Red, Irish Pub, etc.) Forgive me if I don't remember it all - the pandemic didn't help anyone's social life.It's four hotels  in one, you'll definitely find something that works for you. They've done some renovation and upgrades too, thank God! If you're a finicky traveller,  you'll still have a bit to complain about but there are so many trade-offs... Relax! Enjoy your stay!",[]

Service is nice and extremely varied. Customer sercice is very good. The rooms are large and the beds soft.  Amenities ALWAYS work, a major point in a place like Nigeria. The outdoors - pool, gym and other sports area - are large, well built and maintained. Quite a number of restaurants so variety would never be a problem. Large event centres, such that there's always an event going on in the grounds. A very classy bar/lounge on the ground floor for catching a drink and having a great night.Bad: Prices are not for the fainthearted.

In recent I had to call 3 times during my shower time to get solution as the water cuts off frequently.3.

5/5,"My gosh the entire property is so big and nice. The twin towers that's part of the Eko property is like second to none in Lagos, then there's an arts and craft centre, a resort, numerous swimming pools, ATM machines..., the entire property is just like a city of it's own.Then about the security, I'll say it's top notch! A visitor's Uber won't even be allowed to drive past the gate, as all visitors would have to sign in (and this isn't just a sign in of your name and arrival time, LOL). Signing in involves a robot/computer checking if you have a nose mask on, and if you do, if the mask is fit for a nose mask. An iris scan is also done, then a manual sign of name and arrival time, before visitors are issued a visitor's tag and allowed in (note that all these are possible when on arrival, it has been confirmed by the security department that a booking for your visit has been made by the person hosting/inviting you).If by chance you need something that's nowhere to be found within the property, by virtue of the location (Victoria Island), various lifestyle, social and commercial businesses are very close. On one of my visits, we planned to go to the cinema, apparently there was none within the Eko Hotels and Suites property, so we considered the Ebony cinema house about opposite the main gate if the twin towers.Another fascinating thing is the Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems which is centrally managed. The underground parking if about 2 deck is also mind boggling!",[]

If you ask for any room service...Then just lie down and take a nap as no one would arrive before an hour or so...Or you need to followup with them on call to entertain you.... But this practice I have noticed in other hotels too in Lagos...5. The pool side is awesome and quite big6. The food is over price...Example the breakfast is 4 times the price I found in restaurants near by7. Please carry on your iron, in case if you iron your clothes by yourself as they will either won't give you iron or if they give then then will ak you to return it the same day or within few hours...As they have only iron and iron boards8. The ambience is cool9. The reveptionists (almost everyone) are pathetic...They will not listen you.  I will share one incidence... We use to get password for each day though I stayed there for 2 weeks... One day when I was requesting the reception guy for the password for longer duration.. a week or so, this guy's manager warned him not to entertain us...In front of us only...that is the worst experience I have seen in my life...And this doesn't only happened with me...But with my friends also...After this I never went to reception until it was my checkout day.10.

5/5,"Vibe - The best parts are the long bar that is overlooked by several large ample outdoor space between a large patio and a covered patio that can be sealed up in colder weather. The colors are bright and fresh and the music is modern, but not too loud to impede conversation. The place is kid-friendly for the right time of day.Quality - nothing negative to say here. The ingredients always look to be top-notch and are always cooked properly. The beer I've had from them is consistent and without flaws.Sevice - Order food and drinks either at the bar or a walk-up line, so no true table service, but the food runners also bus tables. Every time I've been, the tone has been professional, efficient and friendly.Selection - the food selection is all Asian street food, but skews to various Asian cultures. The beer is dominated by hops and kettle sours, both of which they do well. There are a few other styles they hit as well--stout, porter, coffee cream ale, etc, but hops and sours are what they do best.Food - The one thing I typically mention to people I tell about HOMES is the fact that their beer is really fantastic, but that their food menu may be even better. The menu rotates seasonally, but always consists of a mix of Asian street food. Bulgogi fries are a favorite of mine, and they always have some kind of bowl and a few different types of bao on the menu.Overall, I like Eko Hotels because it's a very professional operation. They have a clear vision of what they want to be and are doing that extremely well. Highlights for me are the new Bahn Mi, the pork belly Bao and the Bulgogi fries. I can't really pick a favorite beer, but some of the best hops are Same Same Different (their flagship), Crumple and Laser Light Show and some of the best sours are the Guava Sherbet, Double Cherry Sherbet and Blurb.",[]
