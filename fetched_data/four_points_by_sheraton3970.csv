5/5,"Four Points gave me a ""wow!"" experience. It's one of the best places I have ever been in recent times. For me it's a great place to be. You can actually feel the warmth of it's great service from the reception. The restaurant offers an appetizing variety of local and international cuisine and indeed some tastes to explore. It is strategically located on the Island and so easily accessible.","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiVZVt3QH7ZTfX-YhSIEUd7nrNo-eILfkQBFIC=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDKmNK3yIcFjVJG1U6YomqFxzVDdKEOFiVER9l=w150-h150-k-no-p']"
2/5,"Let me start by saying The staff is great. Great customer service. Now, to the condition of the property. From the outside it looks as if it‚Äôs a part of the Sheraton Bonvoy family. Upon arriving there was no trolley to carry luggage and I was advised to leave my bags on the floor outside as My Bolt(Uber) had to go. Come to find out they only have two trolleys for a hotel that services hundreds of guests.The hotel is begging for renovations and a mold remediation job, the hallways look like they just had multiple touch up paint jobs and just screamed old and I maintained.I entered my room and it looked good, however once walking in the bathroom the grout was plastered with black and the mirror was peeling. Marriott and Sheraton should pay attention to this property and make it a priority because they will lose money.I asked for another room and the staff attentively listened to my needs and found the best option they could give within their portfolio which was still a 1973 styled bathroom that looked like it needed a bucket and slippers to even step in it.For the price to be close to Lagos Continental prices but the experience to be like this, I would suggest avoiding staying at this hotel.The staff said they will be remodeling the bathrooms soon, until this place makes a large announcement about such my two cents? Pick another hotel.",[]
4/5,The Four Points by Sheraton Lagos is a good hotel to stay in if you‚Äôre in town for business. The room that I stayed in was clean and the service was very good. The staff at the desk and the restaurant were very helpful which made my stay more enjoyable. The only minus was the musty smell in the hall before getting in the room.,[]

5/5,Beautiful and nice ambience.  Buffetüëå They sell mouth-watering snacks at their snacks sessions. I enjoyed their Doughnuts üç© and the ever big and filling meat pie ü•ß.  I will always go for more.,[]
4/5,"I had an awesome experience at this hotel! The aesthetics were great (9/10), and the location is very strategic - one of my favorite areas in VI. The parking space is also big enough. The rooms are spacious, and the use of space is impressive. However, the higher up you go, the smaller the room size (e.g. rooms on the second floor are bigger than those on the third floor). The views from the windows are stunning and capture the beauty of Lagos.The gym and pool were also great. The pool is one of the cleanest pools I've seen lately, and the deepest part of the pool is 5.90ft. There is a tile on the side for you to spit out, which I really appreciated, cos it‚Äôs better than spitting in the water. The pool toilet/changing room is also well-maintained and has the option for hot and cold water.The buffet is amazing with lots of food options, and the ambiance is classy. There's a chef on standby, and the staff are very friendly. I left my wallet at the buffet, and they were helpful in retrieving it from lost-and-found. The bar has a nice menu and a great atmosphere.However, there are some things that could be better. The hotel only has two trolleys, so there may be a wait to use them. The pool is not heated, but the poolside is very chilly. In-room dining (√† la carte) wasn't great, and the food was tiring. Contacting guest service can be frustrating as it can take a while to reach someone, and sometimes I had to call multiple times to get something done (not nice at all). I also wish that a smart TV was provided because, besides football and news, many people don't use DSTV anymore. A Netflix, Prime, or Showmax option would have been fantastic. I know it's possible to have a smart TV option because I've seen it in other hotels.","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFJzHkRqBXrNVvXAmNDKrOpUSmHcKSO7I9t4m3=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzPfMGYHidUmSDgPNaKE4DYEEgpZvq2pW3ETZR=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPy7uCs42mZPJi8Jw8EBsAsD-cd1_E11Lw-FEDM=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFe2pwfqPEx7mDuouRit2uIDh8-o892QAFAlDN=w150-h150-k-no-p']"
1/5,"Not sure how this useless hotel even has up to 2 stars, cos it's the worst luxury hotel ever.

Too bad I was in Nigeria at a moment cash was scarce, I couldn't offer any tip.Located in Victoria Island, which is considered kind of a posh area. I took solo evening walks comfortably. There are nearby malls where one can visit to break the monotony of the hotel room. Shoprite is a walking distance from the hotel, approx 1.5km.",[]
4/5,"This used to be a very nice place to have breakfast. Was fascinated with the dish they served back then.However, there isn't much food to choose from again. It's all so boring with no sumptuous varieties.Someone needs to go to their sister company: that is: herstone hotel @ Ikeja. They av more varieties, staffs are so warm and welcoming, you would feel on top of the world.Unfortunately 4 points by sheraton (for me) isn't doing as well as they used to many yrs ago. üòï You all need to wake up from your slumber.Also on Sundays, av noticed they give out one of their spaces for church services.

They need to make sure the pool area seats are wiped down more. Separate the smokers from non-smokers. The staff can be a bit slow. But, the hotel is so beautiful it covers many flaws. They have security with dogs! So, you‚Äôll always feel safe.It‚Äôs expensive but worth it. Book if you can.",[]
1/5,This hotel is gross. If you are accustomed to western 4-star cleanliness you will be very disappointed. The bathrooms are covered in mildew and stains. Not the kind of place you want your children or pets crawling around in. Management was unresponsive to my complaints and has a policy of charging an extra 1-night penalty for guests who want to cancel the remainder of their stay. I told management that I would be posting pictures if they insisted on charging me a penalty and they did not care. Travelers beware. I ended up going to The George Hotel and having a much better experience both with cleanliness and service.,[]

3/5,"Not a four point like their names implies, Hall has an AC problem and couldn't fix it. The room we lodge was licking",[]
3/5,"I have mixed feelings about this hotel.  First and foremost it is in dire need of remodeling.  Everywhere you go  you see signs of wear and tear and you wonder with the prices they charge for the rooms, drinks and food, why is it not in better shape?  Doors all over are freeing from water damage and age, walking to the pool area and gym you get the feeling of disuse, and you can‚Äôt believe you are staying at a four star hotel.  The room furniture was very old but fortunately the mattress and pillows on the bed were very comfortable and up to the Marriott standard.  The bathroom also needed remodeling, but the hot water was plentiful, so over all I got a good night rest.  They offered a breakfast buffet, which is pretty complete, except it lacks fruit and healthy items.  The staff was hit or miss.  The front desk staff was pretty good, and Kemi was a Star!  The staff at the Brazzerie (their restaurant) needed a little more attention to detail, and the staff at the Roof Top bar was very ineffective and worked at their own pace.  To me the best part of the hotel was the gym; complete and all the equipment was working. The pool was nice, but because of the poor lighting and construction nearby, it did not give you an inviting feeling.  This hotel would be great, it they just spent some money and remodeled everything.","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIfg2vsP6SbsT0-V-qFN1-21OEfW2Tf_ZsqoO6=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc8Bubr36w3uqhc-bZnu4jMYGNT_xbV353v5_w=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOld7ch1lfw8N0DeBRW4T4fkuz4OaDWYPKvIelP=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIdiw-A7wd_13NyJX4IJOofu-Wjni9aZ3RVLbP=w150-h150-k-no-p']"

4/5,"Splendid hotel, very well located in Oniru, Victoria Island and quite conspicuous.Security checks are detailed before drive in, akin to the stringent (albeit dated and thus inconvenient) COVID 19 protocols - which mandates a face mask despite Federal Government advisory that face masks are now optional.Parking is limited but very secure.Visually and sensory appealing aesthetics as expected from a Sheraton property. Helpful and attentive service staff, good meals and functional rooms cum halls.Highly recommended for a business or pleasure trip.",[]
5/5,The Four Points by Sheraton is a lovely edifice. First thing you'll notice is how much attention is paid to security. Multiple security scans at the gate and reception entrance. The restaurant on the first floor is not too spacious and could definitely have more options on its buffet. The staff is nice and decent. I didn't see too many guests on this particular day which made the place quite enjoyable because of the relative peace and unhindered movement around the premises. I will recommend this place for relaxation and business meetings.,"['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyZ1MRSAeoUVx_5rW-xMSNHnapNKumDtNchjM7=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdZ641aISsavn4HDu35dp3e4cg8n_ft3TZcKuP=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpHH_cyvYn8pQ20s7GNveyBwwSHrCt5hw22aEz=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOO5gSr16-VaXBSW35NTci7dGwlrNQw2wdMYRHV=w150-h150-k-no-p']"
5/5,"I went there for an event in one of the hall.Hall seem clean and well decorated by the staff. Food was minimal though, probably the organisers didn't pay for much.Fruit juice wasn't so fresh. Had some sort of fermented taste.Customer service was great.  Staffs From the entrance were nice and polite.  The lady at the main entrance checking people in was really helpful.COVID protocol in check. Mask required to enter the building and temperature checks in place.The rest room was neat. Like really neat (maybe because I was there in the early hours of the morning) might go back there and check during noon or in the evening to see if that level of neatness is maintained.Don't have so much complain except for the quantity of their food.Buffet was mostly snacks and I felt cheated.",[]

2/5,It's so sad to return to Four Points after 5 years to find out the staff is still ill-mannered and sexist as they were years back. Someone needs to give Albert the security some training.  The way the security men here address women remains despicable. It's unfortunate my friend lodged here but  I will ensure she check out today. You are better off going to the smaller boutique hotel where you will be treated with much respect and dignify. Such  a shame!,[]

1/5,The hotel is facing dilapidating conditions. Most staff were friendly but they didn't seem to have sufficient training to handle guests. Carpets and elevators especially buttons weren't clean. The shower cap in my room had been used and returned to the container. Hot water only worked after I sought help from maintenance and even then the repair man didn't seem to know his left from right side. The safe in my room didn't work. I think the battery needed to be replaced. No one fixed it while I was there so I had no place to store my valuables. The AC on my room won't stop working or increase above 18 degrees hence the room was very uncomfortable. The noise level in my room was awful as there was a church service held on Sunday morning near my room and it could easily be heard from my room. They need noise proof halls if they're going to give out rooms within earshot of event halls. You couldn't call the front desk because one is placed on hold as the call routes through their central automated call system and it takes several minutes to get a live response. The gym wasn't working but that is forgivable as maintenance is sometimes needed but what was odd was they couldn't tell when the work they needed done would be completed. The guard outside the elevator in the lobby asked if I spent the night at the hotel one morning and requested I fill in a visitors register. I guess he was unused to seeing a female take the hotel room and believed I must have spent the night there with a male guest. Insulting insinuation but only one of a long list of disappointments at a once fine establishment. The breakfast is still good and is the only thing I'd recommend. Not worth the cost.,[]

Their rest rooms are usually clean and have toiletries. Their lunch selection is very good and have many options. There is s a section you can have sea food pasta, made right there to your specification/taste. I will say I really enjoyed their lunch. The tea break menu was not too impressive some days. But the area I think the hotel need to address is the parking. The parking lot is really small for a hotel of that size. If you are having an event in the morning say 9am, please prepare to get there like 8am so you don't have parking issues. On the last day of our training, we had to park outside.

It would be annoying if you were sad) glued to their face. The security, provided by G4S, is comfortably tight. I can't tell how many floors the building has, as i stopped at the first floor which was where my event was taking place.The first floor is beautiful. Spiral staircase leads you from the ground floor to the circular-built first floor. The circular structure allows easy access into all the shops and halls.I counted three coffee/ tea making machines (espresso), placed strategically for event attendees. The organisers of the event i attended made arrangement for lunch but i missed out because i didn't get a token when i signed in (with the organisers) so i really can't review the taste or grandiose of their meal (i was really looking forward to it though).The toilet (male) is just by the side where you come upstairs via the staircase. It's expectedly neat and every equipment has been placed to ensure minimum contact with germs.I forgot to take pictures sef but one of these days, i sure would go in there to do so.",['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6YQXIznUatnydihtfT6aT9k8K0FXKxBQo_3yw=w150-h150-k-no-p']

Even though the area is not big, the selection is quite good. You've got both local and foreign dishes. I also had one of the best omelettes in a hotel (I call this the Omelette Test (tm)... I use that to judge how good the chefs at different hotels are. The guy here, Ose, by name, did a great job.

The clock slash ipod speaker has the adapter for the very first iPhone so you can't use it. Come on... The ac  filters were so filthy I had terrible time breathing my entire trip I had to be put on medication. Overall, it just looks dated. Part of running a hotel is ensuring its properly maintained and updated. Oh the elevators are so slow during peak periods and there are only two and one was down a few times during my week long stay. And be mindful there is a rooftop patio on the second floor. During the evening the music is really really loud. Like if you're trying to sleep well good luck.

Instead of them to gladly treat anybody they see with ultimate respect knowing they don't have view, they keep driving people away.
