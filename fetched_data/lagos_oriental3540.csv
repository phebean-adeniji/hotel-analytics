1/5,Not five star status. Cannot recommend staying here. Had to rebook another hotel upon arrival because the quality was sub par. Rooms are in need of updating / renovation.

However, it has been able to blend seamlessly Nigerian dishes with of course continental dishes to meet varying tastes and likes. Once you manage to escape the surrounding hustle and bustle including bursting through the traffic from all corners, you will immediately get the calming effect when you step through door. The reception is welcoming to quickly remove any stress you might have had on the way. The decor is not in your face but there is rather this subtlety about that tend to project panache.

4/5,Good location. Just after lekki toll gate which is a major landmark so it‚Äôs easy to access. It‚Äôs set along the sea side so it has great views. The hotel itself is very big with different categories of rooms from classic room to execute and even a presidential suite. However regardless of the one you chose each room is very spacious and clean. The hotel requires 110% deposit upon check in and accepts credit cards. You may do well to book ahead of time as reservations are not guaranteed. There are different types of restaurants to suit different palates and the prices won‚Äôt cost an arm or a leg. The food itself is good but not out of this world. The place is good for events and conferences and the halls are sound proof which is a plus. There‚Äôs a rooftop open air eat out with a great view of the sea and a swimming pool set in the middle. There‚Äôs room for improvement with their service as it tends to be slow. There‚Äôs also ample parking space but no clearly marked signs leading guest to access the building from the underground parking lot. Operating the lifts from the parking lot is also a little tricky. However it‚Äôs still a standard hotel with all the basic amenities. You will enjoy your stay there.,[]

As its name depicts the stars, it is a hotel I'd rate on a personal stance of luxury and ambience. It never lacks for realism when it comes to hotels in Lagos. Because Lagos submerges you into its diurnals, places you into its traffic infested road, gives you a taste of its luxurious side and opens you up to a world of opulence and class.
