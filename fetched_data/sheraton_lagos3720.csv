5/5,"This place is massive and caters for a lot of activities. Apart from lodging facilities it equally has halls for events and conferences. It is cozy, beautiful and tastefully furnished. The restroom facilities are modern and sparkling clean. The hallways are rugged and air-conditioned. The kitchen can cater for your events if you wish. The compound is large, beautifully decorated with ornamental trees and has enough parking space. Security protocols are in place such that guests and belongings are passed through metal detectors before entry.",[]
5/5,"One of the oldest luxury hotels found in mainland Ikeja on Mobolaji Bank Anthony way. Strategically located to offer you easy access to the airport, Ikeja golf club and the Ikeja city mall. They also have a couple of halls here which can be used for your various events and corporate engagements. It was good to see how nicely maintained this place is considering it's been around for about 30+years.",[]

3/5,"The location of the property is fine and the hotel itself is basic. The check in was smooth for our group of colleagues.Room has basic amenities and was clean. Stayed here for 2nights and did room service both times for dinner. Lots of dishes on the menu weren't available for which the staff over the phone was apologetic. The food was OK ok but on the second night I had a serious food poisoning for which the hotel staff weren't helpful at all. I had informed them to inform my colleague about my situation while they call for the hotel doctor, instead they asked me and my colleague to walk to the hospital in the night while I'm crouching on my bed with pain. I was utterly dumbfounded by this behaviour of theirs.This was my first stay at Sheraton in Lagos and I'm happy that I never had to fly to Lagos anymore.","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZsr-6vgWtynDPi7xLsbJuI6WHm3gN4gpjvD1z=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMv1c2_hO4jZZVoMEWumk32zREg7dTiHmY61fAf=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ7F8SHn5u4emSG5-8jPMMvquz96IWhu4YcKQ1=w150-h150-k-no-p']"
3/5,Pretty old hotel but still partially well maintained.Don't bother with cocktails and juices at that swimming pool lounge because they don't seem to know what they're mixing there. Last week I ordered for a glass of pineapple juice and got something that taster like lime juice.,[]
5/5,"A very lovely hotel, but many of their staffs are very unfair to single ladies, no respect expecially when you go there alone, its either you're stopped from going in or make you call whoever you're meeting up there to come out and get you which is very embarrassing... women are humans too and deserves to be treated right, we are not unknown gun men or kidnappers",[]
4/5,"hi, it was great my stay in this hotel, the staff is really nice and attentive. the only thing  wich I didn't like is what I noticed about the way the security floor staff have to perform their shift as they have to be standing for hours with no possibility to sit down for a moment as they are not provided with a simple chair during their shift. I dont know if there's a particular reason for this  but if there isn't, I suggest you to review this matter as I think it would be an improvement for staff well being. thank u  for your outstanding service.",[]

Even though it cost me ¬£22, the food wasn't great.",[]
3/5,friendly staff. there are several improvements that need to be seen from various angles.1) the condition of the room with some scratches and worn furniture. the water from the faucet also looks unclean and safe to use.2) breakfast with a charge rate of usd26 and a buffet that only serves the majority of empty glass noodle and fried rice without egg and meet inside plus most of other food is just potato and soup is not worth the price charged.housekeeping team and other staff are the best. always greeting guests and also helping with any questions asked,[]

Those are the best people.  Unfortunately, this is not the case for the first ones you see ands who will give you a bad first impression: the reception team, full of themselves.Everything so old, the hotel needs refurbishment.

4/5,"One of the best hotel in Nigeria and it is in a strategic location, not far from the airport. Moat pilots and hostesses use to lodge there",[]
4/5,"Hotel is situated about 20minutes drive from the domestic and International airports in Ikeja. Security is top notch and consistent in practice and procedure over the years. A good thing.The lobby area at this hotel is quite expansive with ample waiting area. Lift access is manned by security so be prepared to be asked questions if you are not a guest and intend to use the elevator.The hotel has a number of themed restaurants and on this occasion I dined at the Italian restaurant called ""La Giara"" (la JeeArah /the Jar). Not just any ""jar"" as the traditional translation  is actually the ""Olive Oil Jar""...so now you see the connection? Olive oil and ITALIAN restaurant?üëåThe restaurant is well laid out with comfortable seating arrangement for guests. I started with the Anti Pasti buffet which was quite delightful with an array of different Foccacia breads, cheeses, meats and veges. Next was my main course Risotto and sausage which had a good balance of starch and cream but was short on taste with the sausage. TBH the sausage was quite bland.Overall tab for two people was about $95 without alcohol. Oh yes,  that Anti Pasti is only ""free"" if you order a main course and glass of wine. Still good value in my opinion.La Giara remains on my list of top 5 authentic Italian restaurants in Lagos.","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTx_eeoEpW8vzT8dSQjXNj1eGaoajb-gGCZ-Z0=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_L_UZRF9sp0A72bCFdSN5SCAW6DxPS8WRjMUF=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSI9UOhOxC-We_gI3ZryO81OXpDh7QplFob6Mr=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWYSAH301z7a3FcXI7es63SKCUNKhBxZ6FOYD9=w150-h150-k-no-p']"

Almost drove me crazy when I was sending a document on low power, and one of those switches made me lose the file. Crazy stuff reallyü§ØTo their restaurant, the morning breakfasts were good most of the time, but lunch was unpredictable.

The food is really good! Doesn't matter what you order, oriental Mezze, Caesar Salad, Fish and Chips or Chicken Piri Piri. It's really good. Takes a while sometimes though.Gym is probably the best public gym in Nigeria.

4/5,"First time but wonderful, I am back after some months and am here to re edit the initial review, the security in this place is excellent, you have baggage scanners and metal detector which basically like if you check in at the airport. The reception area is large with nice seat outs, a bar and some pool tables, and the usual lounge music at the background...  yes I have known sheraton for quiet some 20+ years but this time I was careful enough to observe that they actually even can boast more than most of these new age hotels that bill you a lot. The place is well staffed and to my surprise even the room caretakers where still at work even as at 8pm I arrived. The front desk staff are amazing..  Thumbs up to Bami he doesn't know but this is the second time am been received by him, he makes checking in so smooth and very fun, you could even try throwing some sarcasm at him and right on he would play it out. You don't just easily go up the elevator as you have guards manning there, and if your a guest to a guest there is a sign in procedure same applies when your about to leave. Ok so this time I came it's Ramadan, I was skeptical having at the back of my head what I have experienced with some hotels during this period. I asked at the front desk and they said the breakfast was extended by a whole hour plus just to make provision for sahur, amazing right? I well with that at the back of my head and not wanting to believe I went down to see for my self and wala! Breakfast was served as early as 4.00am , usually it's 5.30am. Wow wow, talk of smilling faces this very early morning...  it cleared my sleepy face even before a cup of coffee. The meals great with variety ... please try the sesame bread and thank me later. This place has a great view and I mean from almost all the rooms. The pool area is always filled up at night. Sheraton is quiet close to the airport so very suitable for some to do your thing come back in the evening and move to the airport without much fair of been stuck in excessive traffic.

I felt genuinely welcome despite occasionally hearing a rote-learned pleasantry.Rooms are large and in generally good condition, and kept clean. The food in the restaurants is decent, although the range is a bit limited.If you are feeling active, there is a pool, well appointed and staffed gym, two tennis courts, a short running track through the gardens and some nets for driving golf balls into.The smokey ""Woodies"" bar fills up with airline flight crews in the evening, and there is a lounge bar and a pool bar as well - the pool bar is the place to be on a Friday night, when locals and western guests enjoy live music.Wifi is free if you are staying, and there is a decent (if expensive) laundry service.Unusually I can't think of any major problems, so I've given this hotel a rare (for me) five stars.",[]

Depending on the chaotic traffic, the journey to get here could be a lengthy one despite being so close to each other (go to the WC before leaving the airport).The hotel has had a revamp and more than that, it is a lively place. The reception is adequate, now more customer oriented, desks to book car, internal flights in Nigeria, gift shops, bar, night club, restaurants, it has it all.The conference area is more than adequated for large gatherings, including weddings.The Goodies Bar is fun (more than one way); the Atrium has a lively bar and plenty seating areas around it.The Italian restaurant is a must, not cheap thou. Didn't do the night club outside by the car park, but heard it passes the pleasing mark.Had lunch (buffet at the Pumpkin Leaf Restaurant (also used for breakfast area) and was more than adequate. Bread station, salad, sweets and the hot food stations are a culinary delicacy of African cuisine. Please be aware they seemed to divide hot/spicy on one side and moderate on the other. And spicy but Nigerian food can be very hot.Plenty of fruits.I must admit my special place was the pool area. Cozy during the day, with an outdoor bar/cabana and tables in the shade, you forget you are in Lagos. Peaceful to work on laptops.At night, tea lights adorn the tables and make the bar / restaurant very special. Please note the pool bar closes early, then head for Goodies.There are Tennis court for the adventurous, a hair dresser and a gym, accessed by the pool area.The Gym is not extensive but adequate. Has a shower inside.This visit I went the extra mile and tried their Executive Rooms. The 5th and 6th floor, with a Lounge on the 6th floor.
