5/5,"I loved the ambience that this place exudes. The views of the lagoon from the hotel makes it one of the perfect places for a vacation.I arranged the stay of my team at this hotel, and it was swift and smooth, except for some minor hitches. The customer service team are quick to help, and the drivers are well educated with great manners.The business lounge is also a great addition to their offering for networking.","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWH295FgLVUDnaObwnYdDrRYDNwubuhglf8EA=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNW8lsQYCVaaARsbt9MJgo4qWuDbgFZC1xDPI0=w150-h150-k-no-p']"
5/5,"The service is excellent, as is the ambience. The pleasant employees stood out for me; special thanks to John and Rasaq, who served me and my friend. The music and cuisine were also excellent. The atmosphere was really relaxing and pleasant.I definitely advise you to visit this location.",[]
4/5,"Had the Sunday brunch buffet there today for a group of 9 adults and kids to celebrant two birthdays.The buffet had a good variety of options and everything we tried tasted so good, from starters to main dishes to the sinful deserts.We were pleasantly surprised that unlimited drinks were part of the buffet. That is very uncommon in Lagos. They had bottled water (not the stationary water you have to go get in tiny cups as seen in other buffets we have done), juice, Chapman, sparkling wine generously passed around.The chef came around to make sure we were ok. The live band serenaded us with great music, came to our table multiple times to sing for the celebrants.Few downsides, even though booking 48 hours ahead, the restaurant forgot the celebrants and could only get one complimentary birthday slice of cake. We handled it by writing the two names on the same plate. Also, the cooling was very suboptimal, and we were sweating in the restroom and restaurant. We did mention it to the chef when he came around and we believe he spoke to IT as it became a tad cooler later, not still cool enough though.The downsides didn't mar our experience, and we are looking forward to doing this again.","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjS2i9jwGFPRBZ5GU5IHwyiicu6QCkwLkBASl0=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4ME7SQ-y3HEuAZgzwALfg1o33r0q-Xn93Iw9Q=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMN2CEO6fD2l1oQ8EUHf_0U67Z7rfYmFfeBduCd=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyVO2WyEUU2ZSg1Ic1rjJ8kMW4262PZsCi1S06=w150-h150-k-no-p']"
3/5,"After calling them twice to confirm my reservation for 12 people buffet, when I got there, they didn‚Äôt have a table for me. That already got me angry. I had to wait about 25 minutes to have a table set up for me outside but I complained about the heat and I eventually got a table set up for my friends and I. So in terms of hospitality, I rate the restaurant 3/5. The food was good. There weren‚Äôt many options to choose from but it‚Äôs fair enough. The atmosphere was a bit packed with people so it doesn‚Äôt give you the feeling you probably wanted and the privacy you‚Äôd have wanted for your family or friends. The music was a bit too loud and you often have to talk louder than usual to communicate with your friends. The music (live band) is good though so I commend them on that; 4/5 rating. The aesthetics are not as beautiful as I‚Äôd have thought. Overall, I will rate my experience 3/5 stars. Twenty thousand naira per person is a bit much for the experience you‚Äôll have and not much varieties to choose from in terms of dining experience.","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9VFt6mcynigewQyyaLJne-f0NwNK-n4XEpN2w=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXM0O78DfzvHzTAGotWIUydgrT_PxQCvwsZCHW=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhWuAxD1GHHS2zoHiyze3nDunOwGkCpJ_JUKkj=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPek5_kYX4G3HdEgB_KTFtfHCP4Wt5Vz4nN5Ak4=w150-h150-k-no-p']"

4/5,I marked my birthday here and it was a memorable experience. The thing that stood out for me is the friendly staff. The music and food were equally good also. My family really had a nice time.,[]
4/5,"The location is great and generally the staff was super friendly and helpful (in particular at the business lounge). The food menu is a bit too big, thus the quality varies a lot (eg the pizzas were not nice whereas the seafood pasta was a very pleasant surprise and the Nigerian shawarma is a favorite). In this price league the rooms could use a refurbishment though (they are a bit outdated).",[]

1/5,"This review is solely based on the customer service I was unable to obtain a visa to visit Lagos Nigeria and on the same day I had to cancel my flight the very next moment I cancelled my hotel reservation. Instead of the hotel refunding my Money or at least crediting me for a the nights i did not stay . That's seven nights,   you can do the math on the value. I think it's highly unprofessional to not even at least consider a credit so I can rebookat a later day.  Money grab and careless.",[]

I wasn't given access to lounge at my check in until I called and having that access changes everything. So please don't be shy to ask what your stay is entitled to have. It's an amazing hotel with lots of benefits which you will miss if unfamiliar and restricted to just room and restaurant.

It‚Äôs a nice and friendly environment, plus they strictly enforce covid rules which I appreciated. HOWEVER, due to their EXTREMELY DIRTY AND BROWN WATER DURING MY ENTIRE STAY, I had to use bottled water to wash my face and brush my teeth. I was even skeptical to shower most days. Their maintenance was a bit low, like there was no hot water, and I couldn‚Äôt change the temperature of the air conditioner so I was freezing. Their food wasn‚Äôt even that great either. Outside of maintenance, their service was pleasant, and the rooms are very comfortable, but this was my first time staying in the hotel and it wasn‚Äôt the best experience.",[]

The rooms have lagoon view and city view, both views are awesome. Guests' privacy is considered very important as the janitors are trained to screen guests before being allowed into the hotel. There are security access to every wing of the hotel which can only be accessed through keycards which only guests can have. There is WiFi, a gym, meeting rooms and several marts. It has a very standard restaurant that caters for guests and walk-in diners. The restaurant serves buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner. The restaurant is in a class of its own, it practically serves all kinds of meals. The hotel has an infinity pool and a pool bar.

The hotel offers the best of car rental services, a me time spar, gym and fitness club, a fine dinning restaurant, and state of the Art Bar. While enjoying your breakfast hot beverages on the surface bar and grill, you can take a feel of the city merely looking at the inland water lagoon.This facility is the rarest you can ever get on the island of Lagos while on a vacation, vacation or business trip.While choosing a destination never forget this is Radisson and it stays BLU wherever you go!",[]

5/5,All excellent! the breakfast was also nice.,[]
2/5,"For a ""five-star"" hotel, it was disappointing. Here are my reasons.1) If you want to order from the restaurant,  you have to pay in cash or use an ATM card, they don't allow transfers.2) You can't eat breakfast in your room,  you have to go to the restaurant.3) The WiFi network is terrible, you can't stream anything, so no Netflix,  or any other streaming service. If they had provided it in the custom hotel channels list, I'd understand,  but they only have 10 boring channels to choose from.4) Parking, the parking space is almost non-existent for a facility of this size, it makes no sense. I had to wait a full 40 minutes before the parking attendant found a spot for me, after he completely ignored me to attend to someone with a nicer car that came after me.5) No bathrobes or slippers in a five-star hotel?!!! Really?!6) No porter to help take your luggage to your room.7) The front desk needs emotional intelligence training,  here's why; I ordered dinner (that was meant to take 35mins) and tried to transfer but was told that I can't. OK, that's fine, I said they shouldn't bother. They call back and say that the FnB manager will come to my room to help sort it out so I can transfer while they prepare the meal. I waited and waited, no one came.2 hours later, my assistant that booked the room shows up and they tell her that I couldn't pay for my dinner at the front desk. I was really embarrassed. Never again! üôÖüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÖüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÖüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÖüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI've been to five-star hotels in other countries and this service I got is what you'll find in a two-star hotel in Anambra to be very honest. That's why I rating it two-stars, you can't be five-star and having all these issues.8) The room was nice though,  very well-thought out. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Especially the sitting nook by the window.

The staff are friendly but you literally have to call them before making your room everyday. The maintenance and management is so poor I regretted staying in such a smelling Hotel. The rating here are all fakes . What the hotel does is dedicating a staff whose job is to get reviews. There is no value for money, Radisson should withdraw their franchise with this hotel and it definitely a bad image on them.",[]

Imagine yourself coming back to your hotel after a long hectic day and you are told you should check out now as there is no room for you! Despite that in the morning you made sure with the reception that your stay is extended.Also, when I checked in , despite that I did my reservation two weeks before and I have confirmation they kept me waiting to get a room as they say they are fully booked! Why they confirmed my reservation!!Anyhow, it‚Äôs just because I am a loyal customer I am  raising this issue , and be careful the quality of the hotel hospitality has dropped a lot. I am a regular guest since 5 years now and you can check your system and the Manger on duty, the Lady who was in charge today, was very rude and doesn‚Äôt know how to treat her guests.And this is not the first time this happens I always had challenges when checking in despite my confirmed reservation.",[]

Buffet most times.Wearing a Face mask is mandatory when moving around.  They have a couple of sanitising dispensers around the dinning area and reception.The swimming pool area is so beautiful üòç it was the highlight for me and my kids.There's an outdoor lounge around it too.Overall, It was alright.

4/5,"There were a few short-comings for this supposedly 5-star hotel. But my two nights here were pleasant. I would classify this as 4-star, though.The pros:‚Ä¢ The standard room is spacious enough for two people. The bathroom fixtures were old but clean and some toiletries were provided ‚Äì a shower cap, a normal-size toothbrush and a mini toothpaste tube, the standard body lotion, shampoo and body wash.‚Ä¢ The lobby/reception area is clean and well maintained. The concierge and bellmen are very polite and helpful.‚Ä¢ The breakfast menu has a big selection of pastries and hot meals. I found it tasty.‚Ä¢ The staff were very cordial and helpful.‚Ä¢ The chaises by the poolside are clean with a clean towel for each one.The cons:‚Ä¢ The air and bedding in my room felt damp and the room smelled a tiny bit moldy.‚Ä¢ The duvet insert was old and stained. See pictures attached to this review. The reason I could see it was that the duvet cover didn't cover it very well and so the insert spilled out occasionally. Not a good look at all.‚Ä¢ Room service is slow. It took a very long time to bring up just a glass of juice. I had to call room service a second time to ask about it. And it took about 50 minutes for my breakfast to get sent up to my room.‚Ä¢ The TV in the room isn't a smart TV, so no YouTube or Netflix. But they have news, sports and movie channels.‚Ä¢ The WiFi was mostly fine but the service was a bit spotty in my room and generally good throughout the hotel. I could check my emails, browse the net and social media and watch YouTube videos on my phone. But there were few occasions when it would stop working.‚Ä¢ An iron is available on request but the one I received was way below standard for a 5-star hotel. The settings on the dial to moderate heat were all gone and the buttons that control the steam were missing. See pictures for reference. It also leaked water all over my clothes. Little things like this matter and it's unfortunate the hotel cannot be bothered to replace an obviously broken iron.‚Ä¢ The pool is nice and overlooks the part of the Lagos Lagoon that separates Victoria Island from Lagos Island. But the view is spoiled by trash floating in the lagoon. Now, this of course is not Radisson Blu's fault, but it would be nice if the company worked with the city to keep the lagoon clean, at least the portion of it that's right in front of the hotel.","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcBSGqNPJg9LVGMou4vjSTVxvdj5joCYEeFvPz=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuZYEzC_wem3JRc_5S09MmLlX89thLCaggtws9=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiEqM-BCj5iSHzKXWhSiFT4BSzw0-gsg_lAIV_=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvqQK5rZnNPkU3NCyHZ6_4uB4i2lr1IV0qyD-_=w150-h150-k-no-p']"

From the entry point to the scenery and all-round environment, I was thoroughly impressed.I enjoyed the coziness of the lobby and how well each guest was treated with courtesy.

5/5,I visited the Hans and Rene outlet located on the premises of the hotel. Nice look.. a lot more parking space than I expected looking in from the outside.This location is definitely on my plan to visit sometime soon list. If only to compare the chef's output here with the Ikeja hotel..I plan to come with friends next time so we can experience what they have to offer..,[]
5/5,The food is better now than before,[]
4/5,"The hotel is one of the best in Lagos and it's ocean viewing makes it soothing.They have great service with welcoming staffs right from the gate, to the reception desk and other services. Rooms and hall ways are tidy, each halls which can be used for events have it's restroom which is tidy too.The only off thing is that most public transport claim not to know the bus stop it's situated but it is at ozumba ndiwe bus stop. If you pass Obalende, the bus won't pass there so you'll have to alight at law school bus stop then cross to the other side and trek or board another bus to alight at ozumba bus stop.",[]
3/5,"I am still lodged in the hotel right now. As a ‚Äòfive star‚Äô hotel their service is poor. You call the front desk so many times before they pick a call or get a response. Also the toilet was not properly cleaned. I used a tissue to wipe up a lot if grime on the toilet seat.Apart from that, it has been an okay stay so far. They just need to work on their cleaning & staff performance.",[]

1/5,"Firstly, this is the worst Radisson Blu in Lagos. My Secretary booked this location for me as opposed to the location in Ikeja. Whenever my family and I come to Nigeria we stay in Radisson Blu Ikeja. The service reps on the front desk were extremely slow and poor. It took them 40mins I mean 40 mins to attend to me. The gentleman seemed  clueless as to what room was available. I was booked on the premium/ superior room and the toilets were terrible. They seemed not to care about the state of the bathrooms. Clear brown dirt and rust in between the tiles. Dirty brown marks, where do I start. I had to inspect 4 rooms before I could get a nice enough room only to be greeted with discolored water from the water system. I was told it's island water. Umm, how can a facility like this not have a water filtration/treatment system.. You expect your guests to brush their teeth and have their bath with brown water? OMG, this must be a joke right...thier feedback was, please manage it Sir....The breakfast selection was nothing compared to the Ikeja Location. I was so quick to check out and head to Ikeja. This is the short version of my experience but I won't be coming here again. So much for the waterfront and all.",[]

The indoor restaurant and bar is equally beautiful and we had some entertainment from a live band.I concluded my visit with the wonderful flavors of the ice cream from Hans & Rene within the premises of the hotel and it was magical. Of the entire visit, the only downside for me was parking, there wasn't enough space to handle all the visitors so finding a spot was difficult.

3/5,"Good customer service, much better than Nigerian standards but for an international Hotel located in Nigeria, I expect the price to be favourable and the amenities to be of international standards.I stayed at this hotel with my family for about 2 weeks. The water was yellowish in colour. It turned the bathtub yellow and when we did the laundry service at this hotel, all our whites came out yellow.This was the first place I ate and lodged after I came back from the US. I started having traveller's diarrhoea since my stay here... But it continued throughout my 3-week stay in Nigeria regardless of where I stayed in Nigeria.There are no wall outlets at the bedside. There's no microwave in the hotel rooms and none accessible to visitors. They wouldn't warm up your food even if you called the kitchen.Regarding the price of rooms, I think it's ridiculous that starting price for Radisson rooms in Nigeria is ‚Ç¶104,000 per night with the subpar services and amenities aforementioned. Whereas starting price for Radisson in California (most expensive state in the US) is $129, which is roughly ‚Ç¶54,000.So Nigerians pay double for lower quality service and amenities than what I'd pay in California for better services/amenities, cleaner environment and less likelihood of eating contaminated food/water.And labour in Nigeria is cheap. I'm sure the entry level employees at this hotel don't make up to ‚Ç¶70,000 per month. That's less than the cost of a room in this hotel.My point is... Save your money and find another hotel on the island that's way more affordable and you'll still get the same services than Radisson. This hotel is overpriced.",[]
5/5,"There were many unsavory rumors about the Radisson a few months ago, all pointing to the impending death of what was a most celebrated hotel at the time of it's commissioning. Yet, the hotel seems to be doing very well regardless. It's very nicely designed, the location is beautiful, and the views from the rooms must rank among the best in the country. Service was certainly up to par, and the finish was first class. One interesting observation however - management seem quite permissive of the ubiquitous runs girls, hanging almost like part of the welcoming party right in front of the hotel. Not good for PR for sure. But aside that, this is highly recommended.",[]

I seized the opportunity to wander around the lagoon front and the various meeting rooms and I was impressed by the options available.

Every room has a good view and is spacious.Cons: I was shocked when I tried opening the door and the cover of the door's sensor fell off. I went to the front desk to report it but after telling the receptionist, stood there for 20 minutes waiting to see the IT/maintenance rep, who never came.I also called to request for extra bath gel and salt for a soaked bath, but no one came...no one.Summary: It is a good hotel but maintenance and quality customer service is important to maintain high class visitors, especially at the huge cost they charge.",[]

1/5,I had a booking made about 3 weeks before my arrival. I was contacted by the hotel the day before my arrival to confirm the booking. I arrived on the Boxing day holiday and was kept for hours waiting without a room. My family was kept uncomfortable and there was no remedy to the situation. Eventually I had to make arrangements for another hotel at night. I got to Radisson Blu Anchorage in the afternoon and waited until around 7pm with no service before I left.

4/5,"The rooms with a lagoon view (preferably above ground floor) have absolutely gorgeous views of the Lagos lagoon, sunrise, sunset, nightfall; basically anytime view :) The rooms have a cozy chilling area by the window sill - perfect spot for reading and the views. The infinity pool is amazing and long making swimming laps an enjoyable experience. The outside bar/restaurant has great views too (but carefully check your bill, as the waiter tried to charge for more expensive wine than the one consumed!). The reception staff were very nice and the (a la carte) food was great too (tried the buffet only once when I wasn't really in the mood for food).The room is spacious but has no socket near the bed and was a bit too chilly. The A/C was a bit too complicated to adjust (should have a manual for this) and wouldn't go above 22 ‚ÑÉ. I called technicians twice to adjust it for me, both times they said it would take at least an hour for the room to warm up (to 22‚ÑÉ)!!

Although I didn't book a room, I have been chanced to visit the waterside restaurant twice and I must say is peaceful, serene and offers a good view of the city. The water doesn't smell and it provides really cool breeze. Although on the two occasions that I visited, the waiters were very slow to respond and on one occasion, the waiters just didn't show up. It was really terrible, I had waited for about 1hr and I had to leave angrily.

4/5,I had a great business visit in Lagos and we used the excellent facilities at the Radisson. Staff were courteous and breakfast was particularly pleasant. Even when the water stinks (no fault of the hotel) the ocean view has a calming effect. I do hope they are able to maintain their standards this time..,[]

5/5,Beautiful place and lovely staff,[]
3/5,"We personally had a lovely experience in this hotel, but there's more to be done for this hotel to be better than it is right now. The food (buffet) service isn't too great. There's no free internet on the lobby. The rooms with the lagoon view is awesome. And the receptionist ""Shiela"" was very friendly, accommodating and welcoming.",[]
5/5,"I always love Radisson. The band and lights at night and the sitout facing the lagoon provides one of the greatest relaxation spots for any visitor to Lagos. Meanwhile, the rooms and beautiful (please go for a room upstairs) and the buffet are divine. Solid experience.",[]

4/5,"Calm, warm and conducive environment for any and everyone.Services are great.",[]
2/5,I couldn't sleep for the first night in this supposed '5 star' hotel because of defective air conditioner. The Maintenance guys spent hours fixing this in the morning .

5/5,It was excellent! Enjoyed every bit of my time here,[]
3/5,My expectations for Lagos were not particularly great and the hotel lived up to these. The food wasn‚Äôt fantastic and the chicken was rubbery. The breakfast buffet seemed ok but there were flies on the food. The room was clean but not sparkling as I‚Äôm used to in other countries.,[]
5/5,"I enjoyed my stay at Radisson Anchorage, beautiful ambience.",[]
3/5,It‚Äôs a decent hotel but not a very good hotel . You may not get the same standard which u get in Radission Blue in other part of the world . The view is excellent specially who gets the lake side view room . I could not get it after several requests. The stuffs are interested to know how can they improve ( normally they ask you this question every day Morning during breakfast) but they don‚Äôt act on the feedback.The internet is very slow and the stuff was rude enough to not pack breakfast if u are leaving early in the morning .,[]
5/5,"A five star atmosphere of premium hospitality.  One of the best I've had in Lagos and Nigeria. Good ambience. Exquisite cuisines and their staff- top rated. Especially thanks to @Mr Wellington, @Chima and @Angela to making my stay great in any aspects.I had totally stayed in Radisson VI about 6 months  on and off since beginning 2018 however The hotel just seems to get better and better everyday. Thanks a lot for everything. Enjoy your stay!",[]

5/5,"The rooms are all beautiful and new, the renovations really paid off and the food is nice too",[]
4/5,"It‚Äôs well located on Victoria Island Lagos, it‚Äôs new, modern, and light and bright, has a stylish main reception and bar area, with the latter full of lively locals at the weekends. Best of all is an infinity pool overlooking the lagoon. This is definitely the place to relax after a hard day of Lagos traffic and a good place for meetings too. I found all the staff attentive and friendly.",[]
1/5,"Worst Radisson I have ever stayed In!Room: It smells old and moldy. Noisy A/C. Ants wandering in the room. One telephone does not work but it seems it does, so you spend 5 minutes trying to dial to reception in time wasted. Cleaning service is good.They have a gym but it's not the best.Food is OKish on dining. Only the breakfast saves this hotel and it is not unbelievable, it is good.Watch out as this is not just another Radisson, it's by far the on the lowest level.",[]
5/5,"To be very honest I enjoyed the short time I spent at your hotel. I'd always looked forward to visiting Raddison Blu but something always seemed to come up.I wasn't shocked when I got there and I saw a lovely and serene atmosphere with the staff willing to help and show me around.Don't let me get started on the quality of the fooooddddd.All in all, it really was a great experience for me and I'm definitely coming back to try new delicacies.",[]

5/5,Not bad but communication on direction could be more subtle,[]
5/5,Was at the Hans and Rene for some ice cream. The gelatio and chocolate flavor was impressive. My second treat of vanilla and mango flavor wasn't so much enjoyable. I must add the ambience is Serene and beautiful üëå,[]
5/5,Everything you'd expect from Radisson. One of my favorite spots in Lagos to work while enjoying a cocktail. The breakfast buffet is both continental and Nigerian to awaken your palette in the morning. There's also an ice cream store on location which is very handy in making the  balmy Lagos weather just a tad more tolerable.,[]
5/5,It was amazing having a cordial and professional relationship with the staff of Radisson Blu V.I,[]

1/5,"I was very disappointed by your standards today while I was waiting for my drink order I was approached by your security Mr Cyril who told me that I was not allowed to sit in your restaurant or bar, I asked him why he told me that it is a place where white comes and my dress is much too small. I'm not going to talk here about the fact that he told a black Cameroonian that she was not allowed to eat or drink at a restaurant in a black African country like Nigeria, Because most of the customers are white, I do not think this is the fault of the management of the hotel. but I'm going to talk about the fact that he's also talking about my short dress, you do not have the right to tell your customers how to dress, we come from different countries with different cultures to stay in your hotel or eat in your restaurant. you have no right to judge their origin or culture less than their clothing. if you are black and work in this hotel tell me what gives you the courage to tell a black girl she does not have the right to wait for her drink order because you have some white customer around,  if you don't respect yourself in your country nobody will accept or respect you.",[]
5/5,Beautiful aesthetics and great ambience... Ifeoma and Kenneth were quite helpful kudos to them,[]

5/5,"Quite an experience we had, delighted our meeting went well",[]
5/5,A very strategically located hotel which delivers international standard services. The food is great and the rooms are standard rated rooms. Nothing very exclusive except the water front sit-out and a live band on some special days.,[]
5/5,"Radisson Blu is a lovely place to be. The ambience is great. And the architecture is a testament to the maxim that less is more. I have not really slept in any of the rooms, but I have attended events there both during the day and at night. And it is always the same. Cool. Calm. Secured and above all a friendly atmosphere. Personally and maybe speaking for many other Muslims, the only improvement I would love to see is a dedicated praying area.","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWP3anIkEPsYRQ6urDEdnq2s3107WRC_WgJwUQ=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhrp0a_WDGU9DgsFGI3_vAsPm_A7GwLkL-ii2N=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUomlSpPEBd7QG3c2sFX3t39QhNp1NBRClXf3b=w150-h150-k-no-p']"

The rooms facing the water are nice because you have a nice view and can see the events that happen along the pool side. I happen to stay during the Moet event and got to see a nice party from my window. The Internet was good in the room and was able to get work done. The food at the hotel is nice. The service is a little slow when ordering food. Morning breakfast is from 6-10:30 during the weekdays. The food ranges from pancakes/ omelettes to Nigerian dishes. The gym is small, but has everything you need. I enjoyed the pool and is big enough to do laps in. Lovely stay overall.",[]

Assorted drinks are available; alcoholic and non alcoholic wine, vodka, brandy, and also a special place for ice cream is here.They have about 5 different meeting halls and about two event halls for 1000 guests.But their inability to provide additional car park makes their customers to go through hell when coming .

The waiters took forever to get all our orders and they forgot some things we ordered. Then we struggled to get their attention to remind them a number of times. At a point I had to walk to the service point. Imagine been givn peppersoup and you were waiting to get the water you ordered a good while ago. Also Radisson should do something abt the smell from the water. Like installing a big diffuser or something. The smell got really bad.,[]

5/5,"Nice hotel,  very pleasant staff with really nice food, great views and an ice cream shop that will blow your mind. UPDATE: So I've visited this hotel again and thought it would be fair to provide an update to my earlier review.Staff members are really very polite and their requests about the quality of your stay seem to be really genuine.It seems there has been an upgrade to the Internet access in the hotel. Not only is it a lit faster now but the login process has been made less complicated and you can use multiple devices now.On this trip I decided to dig into the services available on the LG Smart TV in the room. I've posted some pictures of the TV which is powered by a service from Otrum.Apart from having access to a wide range of cable television channels, you can also mirror you device on the TV, though I doubt Apple devices will be able to do this. You can also pair with the TV via Bluetooth.I tested the wake up call on the TV and it worked quite well. The TV comes on at the time you set and gradually increases its volume until you wake up.It's also possible to watch YouTube videos on the TV and you can watch content specific to you by logging in with your Google account.The TV also has a Web browser but I did not get round to testing this.This hotel is doing a great job at keeping up with technology and how it can be used to make guests even more comfortable","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7jlro4w6Hs8QIDtYHyDCkm10BGynfhiW9qQ8g=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlRPV7nEjX40_EoN8c6_uhLlowKHNl_kRcdm09=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaxYH9RJA11kX_TjNNkURO88OZbwpEMiY2Fct7=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNK8j2Un4XlIrcArN8akEE5iVSfI1-ZOgClrh3Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']"

Then he told us to sit in the lobby and wait because the meal wasn‚Äôt ready and we could not use the pool.Nobody was sitting in the lobby and waiting. They sat inside the restaurants and waited for their food.

I thought that was exceptionally cruel. At least water is basic! There was also no ambiance. No mood music. No candles on the table. No extra special kick to get you out of your funk. I regretted the entire splurge. On my way out I mentioned this exact review to the manager and his very insensitive comment was as to the VAT cost of the food. He thought a price tag of N11K for lackluster food and ambiance should be blamed on the government VAT. So I walked away and told him I'd never come back. And he smiled not trying to convince me otherwise. Too bad...",[]

4/5,"Lovely place, very courteous staff from the security personnels at the gate, to the front desk officers. The relaxed ambience is popular to the Radisson Blu signature worldwide, but I would suggest changing the couch in the reception area as it doesn't do justice to the brand name.The lounge bar has a beautiful water front view, while the restaurant is simply exquisite.",[]

1/5,This is quite possibly the worst Radisson in the world.-Bed is bent in the middle- shower freezing- can‚Äôt order room service cause the phone is constantly engaged- air con in room is dirty and stuff comes out of it- they knock your door then open it before you get there- staff get your order wrong most of the time- check out takes 14 minutes- no restocking of mini bar- food is terrible and usually cold if buffet- what‚Äôs amazing is they don‚Äôt give a....about feedbackI hate it,[]

5/5,Nice and beautiful place to be,[]
3/5,"Decent hotel in a good part of Lagos. The reason I give it a 3 star (and want to give it a 2) is because they didn't have a room available when we check in in spite of confirmed bookings. We were 4 of us with 4 different room bookings on a business trip: we reached the hotel around 2330 and were told by the lady at the counter, we have 3 rooms, take it or can move the 4th person to another hotel. Almost a fait accompli at that time of the night. Two of us had to share. We were told that it is due a wing of the hotel under maintenance but I think that was all made up for being overbooked.Room was okay, pretty large. Washroom is huge. Has a shower and tub separately.Restaurant: had breakfast. Large selection. And a pleasant surprise the coffee machine was a Techniworm Moccamaster. That kind of made my anger for the room go away a bit.Will I go back: doubt it.",[]

Warm staff and smart looking people.The rooms with the lagoon view are a better choice for me. The food is nice, but the croker fish my colleague ordered was served in a deep plate with stew sauce rather than the usual full croker laid on a flat tray with pepper sauce and garnished with vegetables. I found it boring and uninteresting, this killed the appetite for the fish.However, the peppered snails i ordered were ok. Not nicely spiced, but i found solace in the pepper sauce it came with.Generally an OK experience.",[]

It is strategically placed by the road side for a drive in on your way to and from work if you want to wait out the traffic. it is an ideal place to lounge with the ocean view that tops off your time at the location. The bar is by the water side so while chilling over a glass of wine or sipping your favourite cocktail, you can see the goings and comings of boats as they ferry people around assuming you are into that kind of thing. Their rooms are top of the class and their service too are of high standards. in the event that you run out of cash, there is an ATM machine for you to restock on cash although that may not be needed since they have POS available at all time. Their halls are good for any events.  You can check out the place on your next visit to Lagos.",[]

Meanwhile, I only hope the management is able to do something about parking lot.
